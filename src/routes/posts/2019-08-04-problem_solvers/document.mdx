# Problem solvers always are the winners
_“The reward for being a good problem solver is to be heaped with more and more difficult problems to solve.”_

— R. Buckminster Fuller

Constancy, dedication and commitment. It is not easy to do what we want, there are many obstacles everywhere, but the main thing is oneself.

As I write this I also try to solve many problems in Kchin, from simple bugs to the big logistical and financial problems, and I know that when I solve some things others will appear. And yes, that sucks; but I have learned something at this time, and that is that at the end of the day those who resist and persist are those who reach the goal, because it is very easy to conceive ideas, what is complicated is to carry them out; someone once told me that the best project is just the one that gets going, the others are just occurrences.

The important thing is to work steadily, ideas will improve, you do not have to have a complete idea to start working on it, you do not have to waste time developing a master plan, you just need to start, work and focus and the rest will come, conditions will be given.

So stop focusing on what you do not have, better pay attention to all the resources with which you count and use them, whatever is missing will come at the right time, not by magic but by simple logic.

There is no greater reward for the entrepreneur than seeing his ideas and work come to life, to see all that was only air and notes become something real and functional.

And mainly remember to enjoy the trip…
